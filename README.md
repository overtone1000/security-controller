# security-controller
Security controller using embedded rust

# Development Environment
- Depends on rustup (taken care of by default.nix)
- Have to install ravedude from https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal
- Must use nightly toolchain? (rust-toolchain.toml)
- .cargo/config.toml, .Cargo.toml, Ravedude.toml contents are very specific.
